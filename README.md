# Secreted_proteins_immunology
A bioinformatics project for screening secreted proteins associated with cancer immunology. Integrates multi-omics data (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) and computational methods to identify candidate proteins involved in tumor-immune interactions, suitable for biomarker discovery and immunotherapy target screening.
